We use bower to manage js dependencies, so 1) add to bower.json,
then 'bower install' will download it to resources/components

Then, do you need it on every page, or just load as necessary?

1) everywhere, add to resources/assets/js/common.js.stefon

2) load as needed look at how we load stripe's js (using
goog.net.jsloader) in frontend.stripe/load-checkout

You have to worry about advanced compilation mode when using 3rd party
js. If you don't have (and don't want to write) an externs file for
the library in question, you can sometimes use aget to get the fn,
then call it, so where you would have written:

(-> js/d3 (.select "somearg")) 

instead

((aget js/d3 "select") "somearg")

chaining won't always work nicely though (js sometimes expects
different 'this' arg than clojurescript provides) so externs file is
to be preferred.
